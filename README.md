# Text-editor-in-browser
Edit your text in the browser with beautiful Google fonts. ðŸ¤“

I've created a really simple text editor which you can use in the browser if you don't have anything else handy nearby to save texts, links, or whatever... I've used Libre Baskerville for the heading and Open Sans for the paragraph for better readability.
The editor using the localstorage of the browser's capacity.
